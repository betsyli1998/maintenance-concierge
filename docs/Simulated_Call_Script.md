## Call Script

Jennifer R. (Agent)0:00
Happy Force maintenance line, this is Jennifer. How can I help you today?


Marcus Thompson (Resident)0:03
Hi, this is Marcus Thompson. I'm in unit B-214 at Ridgewood Heights.


Jennifer R. (Agent)0:09
Hi Marcus, I've got your unit pulled up. What's going on?

Marcus Thompson (Resident)0:12
I have no hot water. It's been out since last night.

Marcus Thompson (Resident)0:16
The water heater is making a clicking noise but nothing's heating up.

Jennifer R. (Agent)0:22
I'm sorry about that, Marcus. Let me get someone out to you. It looks like it might be an igniter assembly issue. We will order the part first. Once we receive the part, a technician will reach out to schedule a time with you. 

Marcus Thompson (Resident)0:25
Ok. Sounds good. 

Marcus Thompson (Resident)0:28
I'm not sure if it's gas or electric, by the way.

Jennifer R. (Agent)0:31
No worries — I can see from your unit records it's a gas unit, a Rheem model. And great news, it's still under warranty so there won't be any charge.

Marcus Thompson (Resident)0:36
Oh that's great, thank you.

Jennifer R. (Agent)0:38
I'm going to get a work order submitted for you right now. Once we get the part and a technician, you will receive a confirmation. 

Marcus Thompson (Resident)0:44
Sounds good. Thanks so much, Jennifer.

Jennifer R. (Agent)0:46
You're welcome, Marcus. We'll get this taken care of for you. Have a great day!
